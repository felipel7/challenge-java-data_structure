# Heap

A heap is a special type of binary tree with two main properties:

1. **Complete Tree**: Every level of the tree, except possibly the last, is fully filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

2. **Heap Property**: In a min-heap, the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children. In a max-heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

## Types of Heaps

- **Min-Heap**: The smallest value is at the root, and each parent node's value is less than or equal to its children's values.
- **Max-Heap**: The largest value is at the root, and each parent node's value is greater than or equal to its children's values.


## Applications of Heaps

- **Sorting (HeapSort)**: Heaps can be used to sort elements in ascending or descending order using the HeapSort algorithm.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Heaps are used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and Prim's minimum spanning tree.
- **Priority Queues**: Heaps efficiently support priority queues, where elements are processed based on their priority.
- **Finding the Kth Largest/Smallest Element**: Heaps can find the Kth largest or smallest element in an array with better performance compared to other methods.
